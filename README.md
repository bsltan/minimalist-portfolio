 Minimalist portfolio website

![Design preview for the Minimalist portfolio website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

We folowed a Frontend Mentor challenge to build out this multi-page portfolio website and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using SCSS, HTLM5 and JavaScript.

The Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

The contact form is hooked on Formspree to have it send actual data:  [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) .
